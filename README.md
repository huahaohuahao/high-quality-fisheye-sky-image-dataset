In order to acquire the high-quality-fisheye-sky-image-dataset, we employed a smartphone equipped with a low-cost wide-angle fisheye camera that was securely mounted on a customized data collection platform, this mobile setup was systematically deployed across diverse urban environments characterized by varying degrees of sky occlusion, including dense high-rise districts, tree-lined avenues, and semi-open plazas. The fisheye camera captured comprehensive sky view imagery at multiple locations and under different lighting conditions, amassing a substantial dataset that accurately represents real-world navigation challenges. This carefully curated collection of high-fidelity sky images, with their inherent complex occlusion patterns, establishes an essential foundation for subsequent model training, segmentation performance evaluation, and satellite visibility analysis tasks.
